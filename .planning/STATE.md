# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-04)

**Core value:** Infographic generation must work without browser interaction — a single API call per infographic that returns a PNG, driven by the same Decision Record data.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Config and Pre-flight

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Config and Pre-flight)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase 1 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-04 — Completed 01-02 pre-flight validator with 4-step validation chain

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 2min
- Total execution time: 4min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 | 2 | 4min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2min), 01-02 (2min)
- Trend: stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Gemini API only (drop ChatGPT) — simplifies to one platform
- API key in `.cdp-context/config.md` — consistent with existing pattern
- Remove browser automation entirely — clean break, no dual-path
- Simplified retry (no hard budgets) — API calls are fast/cheap
- [Phase 01]: Used gemini-2.5-flash-image as default model (gemini-2.0-flash-exp was shut down Nov 2025)
- [Phase 01]: ConfigError with error_code + remediation for dual-audience error messages
- [Phase 01]: PreflightResult dataclass returns result (not sys.exit) for importability in Phase 2 auto-run
- [Phase 01]: Key preview shows first 8 chars only for security without obscuring key identity

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 research flag: Text rendering accuracy for Domain Scorecard is the highest-risk unknown. Flash vs Pro model quality tradeoff must be evaluated empirically before committing to a production model.
- Phase 3 research flag: IPM rate limits are tier-specific and change frequently; verify 3-5s inter-call delay is sufficient by running a full 6-infographic session.
